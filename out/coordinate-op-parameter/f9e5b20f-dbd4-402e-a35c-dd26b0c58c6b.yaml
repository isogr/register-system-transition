  name: Longitude of natural origin
  remarks: 'EPSG DEFINITION

    The longitude of the point from which the values of both the geographical coordinates
    on the ellipsoid and the grid coordinates on the projection are deemed to increment
    or decrement for computational purposes. Alternatively it may be considered as
    the longitude of the point which in the absence of application of false coordinates
    has grid coordinates of (0,0). Sometimes known as "central meridian (CM)".


    SIMPLIFIED DEFINITION

    Is there not a simpler definition than the first sentence? For example (forget
    where I got this from):


    Reference meridian of longitude  (origin) from which eastings are measured in
    a projected coordinate system. Often referred to as the Central Meridian (CM).


    ADDTIONAL REMARK

    "Latitude of central meridian" name from Snyder (1987) used as alias.'
