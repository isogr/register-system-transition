  name: Local Tidal Datum at Pago Pago
  originDescription: Local tidal (LT) datum based on mean sea level (MSL) at the Pago
    Pago tide gauge during the period 2011-2016. The datum is realized primarily by
    the National Water Levels Observation Network (NWLON) bench mark number 1770000
    W with an orthometric height of 2.955 meters above the established LT datum at
    Pago Pago.
  releaseDate: '2020-03-12'
  remarks: Replaces ASVD 02. The National Geodetic Survey (NGS), National Ocean Service
    (NOS), has determined that the bench marks providing geodetic control for ASVD
    02 shifted as a result of movements from earthquakes. Additionally, the Primary
    Bench Mark (PBM) associated with ASVD 02 (177 0000 S) and the Pago Pago tide gauge
    itself was determined to be unstable and were destroyed. Consequently, the levelled
    bench marks and the datum point associated with ASVD 02 are no longer suitable
    for geodetic control. LT at Pago Pago is in interim datum and will eventually
    be replaced by the North American Geopotential Datum of 2022.
