  name: Northern Marianas Vertical Datum of 2003
  originDescription: 'Northern Marianas Vertical Datum of 2003 (NMVD03) consists of
    a set of three independent leveling networks on the islands of Rota, Saipan and
    Tinian (in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands). Each of these leveling
    networks is affixed to a single origin point on their respective islands referenced
    to the Saipan tide station. Island of Rota: Tide Station Rota East Harbor, Rota
    (PID: DG4014, VM: None, Bench Mark: Tidal 3, 1.482 m above LMSL). Island of Saipan:
    Tide Station 1633227, Tanapag Harbor, Saipan (PID: DG3988, VM: 16316, Bench Mark:
    163 3227 TIDAL UH-2C,  1.657 m above LMSL). Island of Tinian: Tide Station Tinian
    Harbor, Tinian (PID: AA4407, VM: None, Bench Mark: Tidal 1, 2.361 m above LMSL).

    NMVD03 was affirmed as the official vertical datum in the National Spatial Reference
    System for the islands of Rota, Saipan and Tinian in the Commonwealth of the Northern
    Mariana Islands (CNMI) by Federal Register Notice (2009), replacing all previous
    height systems for this region. The official defining document for that datum
    was published in 2009.'
