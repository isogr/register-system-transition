    title: EVRF2007 as Realization of the European Vertical Reference System
    uuid: 31ca726b-21cb-48aa-8cff-78e88cd13e1e
  name: European Vertical Reference Frame 2007
  originDescription: EVRF2007 is realised by an adjustment of geopotential numbers
    and Normal heights of the United European Levelling Network. Height at Normal
    Amsterdams Peil (NAP) is zero, realized by least squares fit to 13 stations of
    the EVRF2000 solution. The realization used in Finland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark,
    Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania as well as northern parts of Germany and Poland were
    reduced to the epoch 2000 using the land uplift model NKG2005LU provided by the
    Nordic Geodetic Commission.
  releaseDate: '2008'
  remarks: Replaces EVRF2000. Normal heights are referenced to the GRS80 ellipsoid.
  scope: Spatial referencing
