  name: Canadian Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1928
  originDescription: "CGVD28 is a levelling-based vertical datum based on mean sea\
    \ level determined at five tidal gauges in Yarmouth and Halifax on the Atlantic\
    \ Ocean, Pointe-au-P\xE8re on the St-Lawrence River, and Vancouver and Prince-Rupert\
    \ on the Pacific Ocean. The definition also includes an elevation at a bench mark\
    \ in Rouses Point, NY (next to Lake Champlain), accepted as fixed by the United\
    \ States and Canada in 1925. The datum was propagated inland from the tide gauges\
    \ using geodetic levelling measurements. The vertical datum is accessible through\
    \ some 94,000 bench marks anchored to the ground and stable structures. Heights\
    \ in  CGVD28 are normal-orthometric based on normal gravity."
  releaseDate: '1928'
  remarks: Adopted by Federal Order in Council in 1935. Replaced by CGVD2013 November
    2013. Normal orthometric heights.
