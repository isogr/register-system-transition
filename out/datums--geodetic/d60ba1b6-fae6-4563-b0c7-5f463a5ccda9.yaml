  originDescription: 'Realisation of the IERS Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS)
    at reference epoch 2005.0.

    Origin is defined such that it has zero translations and translation rates with
    respect to the mean Earth center of mass, averaged by the SLR station positions
    time series.

    Scale is defined by nullifying the scale factor and its rate with respect to the
    mean of VLBI and SLR long-term solutions as obtained by stacking their respective
    time series.

    Orientation (at epoch 2005.0) and its rate are aligned to the ITRF2005 using 179
    stations of high geodetic quality.

    Datum defined by a set of 3 dimensional Cartesian station coordinates and velocities
    given by the citations.'

  remarks: 'Replaces ITRF2005. Replaced by ITRF2014.

    This is a purely Cartesian reference frame with no ellipsoid defined.

    GRS80 is the ellipsoid recommended by the IAG and IERS.'
