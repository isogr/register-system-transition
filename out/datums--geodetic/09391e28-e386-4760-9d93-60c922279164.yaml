    title: Maintenance and Enhancement of the World Geodetic System 1984
    uuid: bfeddf94-fe8d-44f6-b871-3444bf413d4e
  name: World Geodetic System 1984 (G730)
  originDescription: Defined through coordinates of 10 GPS tracking stations adjusted
    to a subset of ITRF92 stations at epoch 1994.0. The reference epoch for ITRF92
    is 1988.0; the station coordinates were propagated to 1994.0 using the NNR-NUVEL-1
    plate motion model.

  remarks: Replaces the original Transit-derived World Geodetic System 1984 from 1994-06-29.
    Replaced by World Geodetic System 1984 (G873) from 1997-01-29. Used in broadcast
    ephemeris from 1994-06-29 to 1997-01-28 and in precise ephemeris from 1994-01-02
    to 1996-09-28.
