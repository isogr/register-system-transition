  name: International Terrestrial Reference Frame 1992
  originDescription: 'Realisation of the IERS Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS)
    at reference epoch 1988.0.

    Origin is defined by SLR.

    Scale is defined by SLR noting that the scales of most VLBI Solutions are consistent
    with SLR.

    Orientation is defined such that no global rotation exists with respect to ITRF91.

    In order to insure the condition of no-net-rotation of the ITRS orientation with
    respect to the Earth''s crust, NNR-NUVEL1 was selected as the reference motion
    model as recommended by the IERS Conventions (1992) (McCarthy, 1992).

    Datum defined by a set of 3 dimensional Cartesian station coordinates and velocities
    given in the citations.

    The ITRF92 velocity field has been obtained by combination of eight site velocity
    fields estimated by SLR and VLBI analysis centers.'

  remarks: 'Replaces ITRF91. Replaced by ITRF93.

    This is a purely Cartesian reference frame with no ellipsoid defined.

    GRS80 is the ellipsoid recommended by the IAG and IERS.'
