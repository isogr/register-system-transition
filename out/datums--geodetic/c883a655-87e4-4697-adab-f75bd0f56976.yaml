    title: Results and Analysis of the ITRF93
    uuid: be25e79b-1a21-40b9-abb9-9db4ac22bc48
  name: International Terrestrial Reference Frame 1993
  originDescription: 'Realisation of the IERS Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS)
    at reference epoch 1993.0.

    Origin and orientation constrained to those of ITRF91.

    The time evolution of the orientation follows the geophysical model NNR-NUVEL1A.

    Datum defined by a set of 3 dimensional Cartesian station coordinates and velocities
    given by the citations.

    The ITRF93 global combined solution is divided into three parts: a set of station
    coordinates at epoch 1988.0 (not published), a set of station coordinates at epoch
    1993.0, and a velocity field consistent with the above two sets.

    The consistency of the ITRF93 with the IERS series of EOP at the two epochs 1988.0
    and 1993.0 defines the orientation and time evolution of the ITRF93.

    The origin and the scale of the ITRF93 are defined by holding to zero the three
    translations and the scale factor of the SLR Solution SSC(CSR) 94 L 01 in the
    two coordinates sets at the two epochs.'

  remarks: 'Replaces ITRF92. Replaced by ITRF94.

    This is a purely Cartesian reference frame with no ellipsoid defined.

    GRS80 is the ellipsoid recommended by the IAG and IERS.'
