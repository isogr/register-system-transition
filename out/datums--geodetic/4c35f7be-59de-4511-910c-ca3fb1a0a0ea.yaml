  name: World Geodetic System 1984 (G1762)
  originDescription: Defined through coordinates of 19 GPS tracking stations adjusted
    to a subset of IGb08 stations at epoch 2005.0 using observatiions made in May
    2013. The IGb08 station coordinates are considered to be equivalent to ITRF2008.

  remarks: "Replaces World Geodetic System 1984 (G1674) and used in broadcast and\
    \ precise ephemerides from 2013-10-16. The reference frame was redesignated WGS\
    \ 84 (G1762\u2019) after coordinates of 7 NGA tracking stations were changed following\
    \ station moves and antenna updates between 2014-08 and 2015-06. Replaced by WGS\
    \ 84 (G2139) from 2021-01-03."
