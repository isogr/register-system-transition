  originDescription: 'Realisation of the IERS Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS)
    at reference epoch 2010.0.

    Origin is defined such that there are zero translation parameters at epoch 2010.0
    and zero translation rates between the ITRF2014 and the ILRS SLR long-term solution
    obtained by tacking the ILRS time series.

    Scale is defined such that there are zero scale and scale rate between ITRF2014
    and the average of VLBI and SLR scales/rates.

    Orientation is defined such that there are zero rotation parameters at epoch 2010.0
    and zero rotation rates between the ITRF2014 and ITRF2008.

    Datum defined by a set of 3 dimensional Cartesian station coordinates, velocities,
    annual and semi-annual terms, and post-seismic deformation models given by the
    citations.'

  remarks: 'Replaces ITRF2008.

    This is a purely Cartesian reference frame with no ellipsoid defined.

    GRS80 is the ellipsoid recommended by the IAG and IERS.'
