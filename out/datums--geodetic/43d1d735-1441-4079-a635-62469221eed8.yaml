  originDescription: A realization of NAD83. The original state-wide HARN's were realized
    from an adjustment of data observed in the NAD83 (1986) reference frame to develop
    a set of passive geodetic control values. This was accomplished at various times
    in the early 1990's through 1997. The original HARN's were latitude and longitude
    only. A subsequent realization from GPS observations was made to develop new latitude,
    longitude, and ellipsoid heights. If the latitude and longitudes were less than
    2 cm different, then the original values were retained and the ellipsoid heights
    simply added as a third coordinate. If the latitude or longitude changed by more
    than 2 cm, then all three coordinates were updated. This latter case forms the
    basis for the Federal Base Network (FBN), which is treated separately from the
    HARN's.

  remarks: Replaces NAD83 (1986). It was replaced by the NAD83 (FBN) in CONUS, American
    Samoa, Guam, and CNMI (Rota, Tinian, and Saipan). It was replaced by a corrected
    NAD83 (HARN) in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
