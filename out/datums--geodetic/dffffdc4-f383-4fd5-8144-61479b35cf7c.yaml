  originDescription: 'Realisation of the IERS Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS)
    at reference epoch 1988.0.

    Origin is defined by SLR.

    Scale is defined by SLR noting that the VLBI scale (GSFC and NGS) is consistent
    with SLR.

    Orientation is defined such that no global rotation exists with respect to ITRF89.

    Time evolution is defined by the AMO-2 plate motion model of Minster and Jordan
    (1978); no global velocity field was estimated for ITRF88.

    The AM0-2 model is used to estimate positions at other epochs.

    Datum defined by a set of 3 dimensional Cartesian station coordinates given by
    the citations.'

  remarks: 'Replaces ITRF89. Replaced by ITRF91.

    This is a purely Cartesian reference frame with no ellipsoid defined.

    GRS80 is the ellipsoid recommended by the IAG and IERS.'
