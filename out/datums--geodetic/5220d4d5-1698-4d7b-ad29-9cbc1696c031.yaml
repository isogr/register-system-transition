  originDescription: 'Realisation of the IERS Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS)
    at reference epoch 2008.0.

    Origin is defined by SLR.

    Scale is defined by SLR noting that the scales of some VLBI Solutions (GSFC, NOAA
    and NAOMZ) are consistent with SLR.

    Orientation is defined such that no global rotation exists with respect to ITRF90.

    In order to insure the condition of no-net-rotation of the ITRS orientation with
    respect to the crust, NNR-NUVEL1 was selected as the reference motion model.

    Datum defined by a set of 3 dimensional Cartesian station coordinates and velocities
    given by the citations.

    The ITRF91 velocity field has been obtained by combination of several site velocity
    fields estimated by SLR and VLBI analysis centers.'

  remarks: 'Replaces ITRF90. Replaced by ITRF92.

    This is a purely Cartesian reference frame with no ellipsoid defined.

    GRS80 is the ellipsoid recommended by the IAG and IERS.'
