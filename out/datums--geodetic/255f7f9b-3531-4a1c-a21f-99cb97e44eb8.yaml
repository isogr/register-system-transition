  name: International Terrestrial Reference Frame 2020
  originDescription: Realisation of the IERS Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS) at
    reference epoch 2015.0. Origin of the long-term frame is defined using the concept
    of internal constraints such that there are zero translation parameters at epoch
    2015.0 and zero translation rates between the ITRF2020 and the ILRS SLR long-term
    frame over the time-span 1993.0-2021.0. Scale of the long-term frame is defined
    using the concept of internal constraints such that there are zero scale and scale
    rate between ITRF2020 and the scale and scale rate averages of VLBI selected sessions
    up to 2013.75 and SLR weekly solutions covering the time-span 1997.7-2021.0. Orientation
    is defined such that there are zero rotation parameters at epoch 2015.0 and zero
    rotation rates between the ITRF2020 and ITRF2014.  The datum is defined by a set
    of 3 dimensional Cartesian station coordinates, velocities, annual and semi-annual
    seasonal terms, and post-seismic deformation models given by the citations.

  remarks: Replaces ITRF2014. This is a purely Cartesian reference frame with no ellipsoid
    defined. GRS80 is the ellipsoid recommended by the IAG and IERS.
