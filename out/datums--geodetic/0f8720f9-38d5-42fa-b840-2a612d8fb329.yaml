  name: North American Datum of 1983 (Federal Base Network)
  originDescription: This a realization of NAD83. This datum is closely intertwined
    with NAD83 (HARN). HARN's were realized first as latitude and longitude only realizations
    in statewide adjustments. A subsequent campaign adjusted newer GPS coordinates
    to derive updated latitude, longitude and ellipsoid height. If the latitude and
    longitude values were within 2 cm, the ellipsoid height was added as a third coordinate
    only. If the latitude or longitude differed by more than 2 cm, then all three
    coordinates were replaced and the resulting statewide realization was called an
    FBN. This occurred in 18 states as defined by the geographic extent. A null transformation
    was used for the remaining state HARN's.

  remarks: Replaces NAD83 (HARN) in 19 states as wellas outlying territories. See
    Geographic extents for list. Adopted at different times in the 18 affected states,
    but adopted in 2002 for outlying territories. Replaced by NAD83 (2007).
