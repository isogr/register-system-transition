  originDescription: Defined through coordinates and observations used to derive the
    previous AGD66 coordinates with the addition of point-position and multi-station
    Doppler, SLR and VLBI observations. The final coordinates were obtained from a
    single national least squares adjustment of all observations holding the coordinate
    of the Johnston Origin fixed.
