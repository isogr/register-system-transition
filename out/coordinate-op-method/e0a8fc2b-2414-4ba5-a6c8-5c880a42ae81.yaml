  remarks: "The relationship between NGVD29 height and NAVD88 height vertical coordinate\
    \ reference systems for the coterminous US is available through three gridded\n\
    data files of offsets (sometimes called height differences). The vertical offset\
    \ at a point is first interpolated within the grid of values using bi-linear interpolation.\n\
    The interpolated offset is then applied as an offset: \n\u2022 If a NAVD88 height\
    \ is desired when a NGVD29 height is given, add the interpolated offset to the\
    \ NGVD29 height.\n\u2022 If a NGVD29 height is desired when a NAVD88 height is\
    \ given, subtract the interpolated offset from the NAVD88 height.\n\nMost horizontal\
    \ positions of the bench marks used to generate the VERTCON grids were scaled\
    \ from USGS topographic maps. The estimated uncertainty of the scaled positions,\
    \ 6 arc-seconds, is greater than the differences between NAD27 and NAD83 coordinates.\
    \ Therefore the latitude and longitude used for interpolation of the grids can\
    \ be referenced to either NAD27 or to NAD83(1986) or to any of the NAD83(NSRS)\
    \ realisations (HARN, NSRS2007 or 2011). "
