  remarks: This model provides the relationship between a global reference frame (ie
    one of the ITRFs) and the local reference frame (NZGD2000). It includes both functional
    definitions and spatial representations for a range of geophysical deformation
    sources that are represented as discrete sub-models. Each sub-model may include
    both horizontal and vertical deformation elements, as well as uncertainties.  A
    sub-model is built of one or more components (such as co-seismic and post-seismic
    components) that when added together give the total deformation for that event.
    Each component consists of a time function and a spatial representation. The time
    function defines how a time-based scale factor gets applied to each deformation
    element.
