  remarks: 'The latitude, longitude and height offsets at a point are derived by interpolation
    within the gridded data. Separate grid files are given for latitude, longitude
    and height offsets. The grid file format is given in documentation available from
    the information source. Biquadratic interpolation is used to derive the offset
    values. For the forward calculation the interpolated value of the offset is then
    added to the source CRS coordinate value to give the coordinates in the target
    CRS. Transformations between NAD83(HARN) and all subsequent realizations of NAD83
    are expressed in 3D with latitude, longitude and height offsets. This operational
    method is designed to use all three operational parameters. Previous realizations
    of NAD83 were only 2D and use a different operational method. NADCON includes
    all versions from 1 through 5 (released in 2017). While the first and the last
    used slightly different grids and interpolation methods, the differences are deemed
    to be within the errors of the methods and considered equivalent. Hence users
    of NADCON 2.1 should generate equivalent results for transformations using NADCON
    5.0. Note that this operational method is for 3D transformation. Another method
    uses only a 2D transformation (latitude and longitude only).


    Reversibility: Iteration is required for the reverse transformation. The coordinate
    reference system for the coordinates of the grid nodes is the source coordinate
    reference system for the forward transformation. Then in forward transformations
    the offset is obtained through straightforward interpolation of the grid file.
    But for the reverse transformation the first grid interpolation entry will be
    the value of the point in the second coordinate reference system, the offsets
    are interpolated and applied with sign reversed, and the result used in further
    iterations of interpolation and application of offset until the difference between
    results from successive iterations is insignificant. '
